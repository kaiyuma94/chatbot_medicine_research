# Chatbot Conversation Analysis

This project contains scripts for the analysis of chatbot conversations from a pilot study with BSc Medicine students.

## Scripts

The project uses both R and Python scripts for different purposes.

### R Scripts (`RScripts/`)

The R scripts are used for the statistical analysis and visualization of the conversation and survey data.

### Python Scripts (`Python_scripts/`)

The Python scripts are responsible for data handling. They are used to process the raw conversation logs and prepare them for analysis.
