assistant,"Great! Letâs start with the clinical scenario to set the stage for our learning.

A healthy 25-year-old woman had routine prenatal care. At 24 weeks of pregnancy, an ultrasound revealed a small opening (~5 mm) on the right side of the babyâs belly, near the umbilical cord. Genetic tests at 26 weeks were normal. Over time, the opening enlarged (up to 34 mm), and parts of the babyâs intestines were seen floating in the amniotic fluid. The baby also measured smaller than expected. At 37 weeks, a caesarean section was performed. The newborn boy had parts of his small and large intestines, and stomach, located outside the abdomen. The supporting tissue was short, and the bowel appeared swollen. The diagnosis was gastroschisis, a defect in the abdominal wall.

Letâs begin with a foundational question:

**What is gastrulation?**",2025-09-17T15:29:34.243246+00:00
user,"Gastroschisis is een geboorteafwijking waarbij de darmen van de baby zich buiten de buik uitstrekken via een gat naast de navel. De grootte van het gat is variabel en andere organen, waaronder de maag en de lever, kunnen ook buiten het lichaam van de baby voorkomen.",2025-09-17T15:31:51.060472+00:00
assistant,"You described gastroschisis well, but letâs focus first on the theory behind early embryonic development, as thatâs key to understanding how such defects happen.

My question was: **What is gastrulation?**

If youâre unsure, can you tell me anything you remember about this stage of development? For example, does it involve the formation of layers, or is it about growth of organs?",2025-09-17T15:31:58.65203+00:00
