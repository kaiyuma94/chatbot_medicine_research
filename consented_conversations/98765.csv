assistant,"Letâs use the clinical vignette to set the stage:

A healthy 25-year-old woman had routine prenatal care. At 24 weeks of pregnancy, an ultrasound revealed a small opening (~5 mm) on the right side of the babyâs belly, near the umbilical cord. Genetic tests (amniotic fluid analysis) at 26 weeks were normal. Over time, the opening enlarged (up to 34 mm), and parts of the babyâs intestines were seen floating in the amniotic fluid. The baby also measured smaller than expected. At 37 weeks, a caesarean section was performed. The newborn boy had parts of his small and large intestines, and stomach, located outside the abdomen. The supporting tissue was short, and the bowel appeared swollen. The diagnosis was gastroschisis, a defect in the abdominal wall.

Letâs keep practicing with key terms essential for understanding the vignette and embryology.  
Can you name the **three primary germ layers** formed during early embryonic development?",2025-09-17T15:33:22.776044+00:00
